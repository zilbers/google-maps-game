The road leading to the Ovda Valley (Route 40) climbs from the Arava and passes Kibbutz Neot Smadar, whose grape vineyards are spectacular green spots in the desert, about 60 kilometers north of Eilat.</p>\r\n<p>Despite its rugged appearance, the land of the Uvda Valley is remarkably rich, having been swept away from the surrounding mountains for thousands of years. This made it a preferred destination for settlement, since the prehistoric period. The ancient inhabitants of the valley were scattered throughout the region and experts uncovered more than 150 settlement sites, ranging in age from 10,000 to 6,000 years.</p>\r\n<p><br /><strong>Events &amp; Attractions: </strong><br />One of the fascinating sites in this area is located close to Route 40, close to the modest community of Ma'ale Shacharut. It is called the \"Tigers' Temple\" - a 9,000-year-old compound with stones engraved with mysterious catlike figures. South of the temple, about 460 meters from the road, are smooth, glistening dunes that are especially suitable for surfing and fun.</p>\r\n<p>The Ma'ale Shacharut mountain range provides a spectacular view of the Arava Valley and the Red Mountains in Jordan. This is just one of the highlights of the region. Its hidden charm has made it a favorite site for camel tours, hikes, jeeps, and bicycles, which can all be arranged through tourist service providers in Eilat and elsewhere.</p>\r\n<p>Between the nature reserve of the Eilat Mountains, there are wonderful hiking trails. One of these is the Red Canyon, where you can climb and descend on ladders.</p>\r\n<p><br />Transportation: <br />Transportation in this area is based on intercity buses and private vehicles.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://info.goisrael.com/en/attractions#/specFilters=6m!#-!14&amp;pageSize=24&amp;viewMode=grid&amp;orderBy=0&amp;pageNumber=1\" target=\"_blank\">For more information about attractions in the area click here</a><br /><a href=\"https://info.goisrael.com/en/hotels-2#/specFilters=6m!#-!14&amp;pageSize=24&amp;viewMode=grid&amp;orderBy=0&amp;pageNumber=1\" target=\"_blank\">For more information about hotels in the area click here</a><br /><a href=\"https://info.goisrael.com/en/restaurants#/specFilters=6m!#-!14&amp;pageSize=24&amp;viewMode=grid&amp;orderBy=0&amp;pageNumber=1\" target=\"_blank\">For more information about restaurants in the area click here</a></p>",

      "FullDescription": "<p>Shfar'am is a city in the Northern District of Israel. The city covers seven hills, and its jurisdictional area is 5,500 acres. It is located a short distance from the cities of Haifa, Akko, and Nazareth, giving its resident's employment opportunities in these cities.</p>\r\n<p>A settlement called Shfar'am is mentioned in the days of the Mishnah and the Talmud. The city's Arabic name is Shafa Amr (Omar's recovery), hinting at the legend that tells of the Muslim commander Omar al-'Az who drank from a local well and recovered from his illness.</p>\r\n<p>In 1773, Daher al-Amar, who ruled the Galilee at the time, built a large citadel in Shfar'am , which still overlooks the city. Under the auspices of al-Omar, the Jewish settlement was renewed, and in his day, Rabbi Chaim Abulafia renewed the local synagogue.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Events &amp; Attractions:</strong></p>\r\n<p>In Shfar'am you can find a variety of fascinating sites such as the Great Saraya Fortress built in 1760, the old Shekhina Camp which was renovated in 1988, the \"Tower\" (El Barj), the Crusader fortress that was renovated in the 18th century, and the Church of St. Peter and Paul Greek Catholic church built in the 18th century.</p>\r\n<p>Every year, Shfar'am hosts a variety of unique and fascinating events and festivals, including the \"No Words\" pantomime festival that takes place every Passover in the city and includes amazing pantomime shows from Israel and around the world. The aim of the festival is to bring Arabs and Jews closer together because pantomime - the language of movement - is a universal language.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Transportation:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Transportation in the city is based on inter-city buses, city buses, taxis and private vehicles.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://info.goisrael.com/en/attractions#/specFilters=6m!#-!18&amp;pageSize=24&amp;viewMode=grid&amp;orderBy=0&amp;pageNumber=1\" target=\"_blank\">For more information about attractions in the area click here</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://info.goisrael.com/en/hotels-2#/specFilters=6m!#-!18&amp;pageSize=24&amp;viewMode=grid&amp;orderBy=0&amp;pageNumber=1\" target=\"_blank\">For more information about hotels in the area click here</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://info.goisrael.com/en/restaurants#/specFilters=6m!#-!18&amp;pageSize=24&amp;viewMode=grid&amp;orderBy=0&amp;pageNumber=1\" target=\"_blank\">For more information about restaurants in the area click here</a></p>",
